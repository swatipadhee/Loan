      "Key: introduction, Value: The challenge is to build a model that predicts at application time whether an applicant will become bad loan or not. The data consists of a set of variables that describe the requested loan and the applicant's credit attributes (annual income, debt-to-income ratio, number of credit inquiries in the last 6 months, etc.). These data are based on actual real-life loans obtained publicly with some modifications. We have split the data into two separate datasets, one for training the model and the other for validating it. We also provide a data dictionary, which contains brief descriptions of the meaning of each variable. Note: Not all of the variables are suitable for constructing the model.

    "###We have 7 outliers in bc_util (Ratio of total current balance to high credit/credit limit for all bankcard accounts). It is important to decide how to handle them, as they could have a significant impact on our model performance. First thing to try is to check for typo errors. Manually inspecting, the first row in above display with id 10020611 has tot_cur_bal = 7420.0 and tot_hi_cred_lim = 680.464616. bc_util should be tot_cur_bal/tot_hi_cred_lim = 7420/680.464616 = 10.904314237. But it is 339.6. First, we can correct this error as below:"
