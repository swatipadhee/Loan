# Loan Default Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan applicant will default on their loan based on various financial features. The dataset includes information like loan amount, interest rate, and applicantâ€™s income. The goal is to train a machine learning model to classify loan applications as either "good" or "bad".

## Requirements
To run the code, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `torch`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install these dependencies by running:
conda create --name loan-prediction python=3.8
conda activate loan-prediction
conda install --file requirements.txt

Change path variables as needed.
